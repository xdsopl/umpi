umpi is written arround process_vm_readv and process_vm_writev in C++11 and uses libc++ for its full C++11 support.
To ease the IPC over shared memory, it uses based_ptr, which only saves the offset to a base address (e.g. the starting address of the shared memory map).
Finally, a pool allocator using based_ptr and the nice libc++ allows us to use std containers for the IPC.

Processes communicate entirely over shared memory and no sockets get opened.
This allows us to start thousands of processes on a single shared memory Computer.
